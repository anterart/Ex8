If we store the token locally:
Advantage: save time and better performance (no need to query the server for our token all the time)
Disadvantage: less secure, anyone who has access to the client can obtain the token

If we store the token in the server:
Advantage: more secure, only the server has access to the token
Disadvantage: more queries are sent to the server to get the token, less efficient
